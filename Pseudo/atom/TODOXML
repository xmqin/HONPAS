Complete the split-off of pseudoXML for offline processing.

1. Use only the PSFX file (PSF + PSWFFMT) to get the information.
2. zo, no, lo can be extracted from the ps header by a tight routine.
3. Maybe use the pseudopotential module in Siesta to ease the parsing
   of the files.

The final result should be an ATOM code which remains f77, and close
to the original one. Any fancy stuff should be done with wrappers.
