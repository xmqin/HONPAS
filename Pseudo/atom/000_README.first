For a simple compilation, edit the FC and FFLAGS symbols in file "makefile", and
type "make".

If you need XML support, make sure that you have compiled the wxml library in the main
Siesta directory, and type "make -f makefile.xml".


Special notes for Alpha computers:

If you run into trouble with arithmetic errors, edit
makefile and toggle the XC_OBJS lines (to use the old
version of the Soler-Balbas routines).
