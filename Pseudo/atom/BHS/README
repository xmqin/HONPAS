This package processes BHS fitting parameters and produces an
ATM-compatible pseudopotential file. It uses the method proposed by
Warren Pickett in his review.

The original reference is "Pseudopotentials that work: From H to Pu", by
G.B. Bachelet, D.R. Hamann, and Michael Schluter, PRB...

BHSINP is a sample input file for Ni (with a very strong d
pseudopotential, by the way...)

shirley_bhsfit.for contains code from Eric Shirley that purports to do
the same thing.
