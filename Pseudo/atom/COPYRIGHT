This is the atomic program originally written (circa 1982) by Sverre
Froyen at the University of California at Berkeley, modified starting
in 1990 by Norman Troullier and Jose Luis Martins at the University of
Minnesota, and currently maintained by Alberto Garcia, who added some
features (such as the calculation of logarithmic derivatives) and made
substantial structural changes to the April 1990 (5.0) Minnesota
version while at Berkeley and elsewhere.

Jose Luis Martins is maintaining his own version of the code.
