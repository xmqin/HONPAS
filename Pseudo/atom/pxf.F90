! The name pxf is intended to be reminiscent of the POSIX
! fortran interfaces defined by IEEE 1003.9-1992, although
! in fact I don't think that either flush or abort were
! covered by said standard.

! Of the preprocessor defines used here, only xlC is
! automatically defined by the appropriate compiler. All
! others must be defined by some other mechanism - I
! recommend autoconf.

  
! FLUSH: flushes buffered output on a given unit. Not guaranteed
! to do anything at all (particularly under MPI when even FLUSHed 
! buffers may not make it to the host cpu after an abort.
!
! IMPLEMENTATION: in F2003, this is a native operation called by the
! FLUSH statement.
! In almost every compiler, there is a FLUSH intrinsic subroutine 
! available which takes one argument, the unit to be flushed.
! (some will flush all open units when no argument is given - this 
!  facility is not used here.
! NAG complicates matters by having to USE a module to get at flush.
! 
! If no FLUSH is available, the subroutine is a no-op.

subroutine pxfflush(unit)
#ifdef __NAG__
  use f90_unix_io, only : flush
#endif
  integer, intent(in) :: unit

#if defined(F2003)
  flush(unit)
#elif defined(xlC)
  call flush_(unit)
#elif defined (FC_HAVE_FLUSH)
  call flush(unit)
#else
  continue
#endif

end subroutine pxfflush

! ABORT: terminates program execution in such a way that a backtrace
! is produced. (see abort() in the C Standard Library). No arguments.
!
! IMPLEMENTATION: In F2003, the C interoperability features mean that
! the abort in stdlib.h is available to be linked against.
! In several other compilers an ABORT intrinsic subroutine is available.
! Again, NAG complicates matters by needing to USE a module.
!
! In the case where no native ABORT can be found, we emulate one
! by dereferencing a null pointer. This has reliably produced coredumps
! on every platform I've tried it with. Just in case it doesn't (it need
! not even stop execution) a stop is given to force termination.
