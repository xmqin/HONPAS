In this test, the h2o.VERLET_RESTART file is removed before attempting
to re-start the calculation. Only the information in the h2o.XV is
read, and the simulation effectively re-takes the last point computed
in the previous run (instead of moving on to the "following point", as
it is possible with the restart file). When comparing this
concatenation of runs with the one in the md-single-run directory,
care should be taken to remove these "repeated" points.

The easiest is to edit the .MDE file and remove all the "1-numbered"
steps except the first.
