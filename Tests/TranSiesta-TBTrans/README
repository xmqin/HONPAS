Automated tests for TranSiesta-TBTrans

A copy of the Tests directory is placed by the Src/obj_setup.sh script
into the compilation directory (which by default is Obj, but any number of
compilation directories can be created, as explained in the manual --
we will refer to this compilation directory as OBJDIR). The original
Tests directory should therefore be kept clean, and all the work done
in the relevant copy.

For the default mode of operation, go into any subdirectory of the
current directory (OBJDIR/Tests/TranSiesta-TBTrans) and type
'make'. This will execute a script that first runs the "electrode"
calculation, and then the "scattering region" calculation and the
TBTrans post-processing.

Reference output files can be found in directory
Tests/Reference/TranSiesta-TBTrans.

To use a different Siesta executable (i.e., other than the default,
which is the one compiled in OBJDIR), use:

make TS=/full/path/to/siesta

This technique is also useful for other execution environments. For
example, to run OBJDIR/siesta in parallel (assuming the right path
and libraries for mpirun are set):

make TS="mpirun -np 2 ../../../../siesta"

The source for TBTrans resides in Util/TS/TBtrans. 
To guarantee that the TBtrans executable is
compatible with the TranSiesta executable in OBJDIR, TBtrans is
re-compiled with the appropriate settings in OBJDIR/arch.make.

To override the default TBtrans executable in Util/TS/TBtrans, TBT can be
specified in the command line:

make TBT=/full/path/to/tbtrans
