Automated tests for Siesta.

A copy of the Tests directory is placed by the Src/obj_setup.sh script
into the compilation directory (which by default is Obj, but any number of
compilation directories can be created, as explained in the manual --
we will refer to this compilation directory as OBJDIR). The original
Tests directory should therefore be kept clean, and all the work done
in the relevant copy.

Assuming that Siesta has been compiled in OBJDIR, go into any test
subdirectory of OBJDIR/Tests and type 'make'

Reference output files can be found in directory Reference.

To use a different Siesta executable (i.e., other than the default,
which is the one compiled in OBJDIR), use:

make SIESTA=/full/path/to/siesta

This technique is also useful for other execution environments. For
example, to run OBJDIR/siesta in parallel (assuming the right path
and libraries for mpirun are set):

make SIESTA="mpirun -np 2 ../../../siesta"


The TranSiesta tests are grouped under the TranSiesta-TBTrans directory.
