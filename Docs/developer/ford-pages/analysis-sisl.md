title: Analysis using Python (sisl)

Siesta comes with a large amount of utilities.

A second approach to analyze output of Siesta and TranSiesta is to use the
Python library [sisl](http://www.github.com/zerothi/sisl), developed by Nick R. Papior.

sisl has its own documentation which may be found in the above link.

The library allows reading the Hamiltonian, overlap, density matrices as well as all
grid related quantities. Subsequent analysis such as wavefunction calculations, eigenvalues,
PDOS as well as calculating grid differences etc.

There are specific [tutorials](http://zerothi.github.io/sisl/docs/latest/tutorials.html#siesta-transiesta-support)
for Siesta which highlights just a few of the many features sisl implements.
