title: Program Overview

These pages provide some documentation on the internals of the SIESTA program.

This is work in progress. Just a few pages are present, and
their integration with the in-code documentation is not yet very
complete. This is likely to remain so in this 4.1 version, but the
documentation will improve in further releases.
