This directory contains several utilities related to TranSIESTA.
Scripts to help generate input fdf files and do transmission
analysis are located here.

Unless otherwise stated all programs/utilities have been developed

- tselecs.sh
  This small scripts eases the creation of several electrodes
  input. It can also be used to initialize a script for TranSIESTA.
  Call with:
    tselecs.sh -2
  to generate a default input FDF for TranSIESTA which defaults
  to the old versions implementation.

- TBtrans
  this directory contains the TBtrans utility which is used for 
  calculating the transmission and other quantities from the 
  TSHS files output from TranSIESTA.

  It also reads NetCDF4 files created by the community utility:

- ts2ts
  A small utility which takes an old input file for TranSIESTA
  and converts it into the new input format.
  First make the utility in the folder and then you can utilise it as:
    ts2ts <fdf-file> 
  and it will print out a converted fdf-input file.
  It is made for piping directly into another file.

  Easy usage will append to the FDF file:
    ts2ts run.fdf >> run.fdf

  REMARK: It will only read in TranSIESTA/TBtrans options and thus
          also only print TranSIESTA/TBtrans options. 
	  It will not copy any other FDF-flags.

- tshs2tshs
  Converts TSHS files to other version files.
  Currently there exists two file versions:
   0 : old TSHS format (compatible with all programs)
   1 : new TSHS format (not compatible with all programs), but 
       have a drastic memory decrease  

- Tight-binding
  To use tight-binding parameters compatible with TBtrans
  you can use the utility created here:
