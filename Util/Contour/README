GRID2D

A program to translate values of a function in a 3D grid to a 2D grid,
for 2D analysis and contour plotting. It does trilinear interpolation.

It takes grid-defined functions generated by SIESTA (like RHO, DRHO, etc).

The 2D output is prepared for the making of contour plots with GnuPlot, 
but it could be easily adapted to other formats. 
The files gnux11 and gnups are for the automatic generation of plots
for a grid2d output named 'file.2d'. They can be easily modified for
particular needs within the capabilities of GnuPlot.

Input comes through standard input, as explained in the source code
grid2d.f . Two types of input for defining the 2D window have been 
devised (raw and no-raw) and are exemplified in raw.in and noraw.in .

Compiling straight:

    make all

It is a quite preliminary version. It will be revised for
including spin densities, using fdf (possibly the one used in the
SIESTA calculation), improving interpolation, etc. 

GRID1D

Similar but outputs along a line in stead of a plane.
