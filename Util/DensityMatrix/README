Utilities to convert between the classic DM and netCDF format, and to
filter the contribution of certain orbitals to the DM.

Also, experimental octave scripts to read DM.nc and DMHS.nc files.

dmbs2dm and dmUnblock are used to convert "blocked" DM (or H or S)
files to the classic Siesta format.

To allow reuse of non-collinear DM files produced with versions <
4.0.2, use the program dm_noncol_sign_flip4.
