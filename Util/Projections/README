This directory contains a program "orbmol_proj" to project the states
of a system onto some of the orbitals of one of its subsystems. For
example, the system could be a surface plus and adsorbed molecule, and
the subsystem the molecule itself.

The Example directory provides two examples using a toy Na surface
with a single Na atom on top, at two different heights, to show the
qualitative differences between the projections in the "no binding"
and the "chemisorbed" cases.
