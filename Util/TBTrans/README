Brief Description:

The tbtrans code is used in order to obtain, in a post-processing way,
the transport properties after a TranSIESTA run. It was developed by
M. Brandbyge, and the present version contains some modifications made
by F. D. Novaes.

In order to run it, it requires the electrode's TSHS files (may be
just one file if the left and right electrodes are equal), and the
scattering region's TSHS file. These are generated in a TranSIESTA
run.  The location of these files are specified by the (fdf) input
options:

TS.HSFileLeft  
TS.HSFileRight
TS.TBT.HSFile

respectively for the left and right electrodes and the scattering
region (for the latter one, if nothing is specified, it is assumed
that the file name is is “system label”.TSHS file, and located in the
same directory from where the calculation is being launched).

The energy widow and number of points for the computation of the
transmission function is specified by

TS.TBT.Emin 
TS.TBT.Emax 
TS.TBT.NPoints

The current will be computed using the resulting transmission
function, so be sure to make it suited for the integration in the bias
window.

The averaged (over k-points) transmission function is printed in the
file “system label”.AVTRANS.

The present version of the code is only parallelized over k-points, so
the number of nodes should not be bigger than the number of k-points.

To compile, type "make". 
You might need to edit Makefile to add extra linear-algebra support.
