Please use the sockets.sh script to test the basic functionality:

If you have compiled Siesta in the standard Obj directory, simply type:

    sh sockets.sh

If you have compiled Siesta in the Gfortran directory:

    OBJDIR=Gfortran sh sockets.sh

Alternatively, you can use
    
    SIESTA=/path/to/siesta sh sockets.sh

Once you get familiar with the operation, you can move on to use the "test.sh"
script and/or adapt it to your needs.
