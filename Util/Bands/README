Tools to deal with band-structures:

-- gnubands: Convert a .bands file produced by Siesta to a form
   	     suitable for plotting with gnuplot.

-- eigfat2plot: Convert an .EIGFAT file produced by the "fat" program
   		in Util/COOP to a form suitable for plotting
   		"fatbands" by gnuplot (example in fat.gplot)
