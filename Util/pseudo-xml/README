xml2psf converts pseudopotential files in xml format
to the classic "psf" format.

The XML format is that defined in Junquera,Garcia,Verstraete
(to be published).

Installation:

Make sure that there is a file called "arch.make" in 
the top build directory (Src in most cases).

xml2psf needs the XML parser functionality (SAX interface),
which is by default assumed to be in ../../Src/xmlparser.

(NOTE: This setup is not yet "VPATH-friendly")

Usage:

xml2psf expects to find the XML pseudo in "PSXML", and
writes the result of the conversion to "PSF", so a typical
workflow could be:

ln -sf Mypseudo.xml PSXML
./xml2psf
mv PSF Mypseudo.psf

A Fe.xml file has been provided for testing purposes.

Caveats:

This version does not update the "total ps generation charge 
density" field in the psf file. You need to modify the source
if you intent to use with hybrid atoms (which is very unlikely).

pseudopotential.f is a stripped-down version of the file found 
in the main Src directory.
