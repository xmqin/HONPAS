In the example directories, use the fdf file both to run Siesta and
to execute the 'stm' program compiled in ../Src (each program will use only the
keywords that are relevant to it).

The wavefunctions will come out in the SystemLabel.fullBZ.WFSX file. You have
to rename it (or make a symbolic link) to SystemLabel.WFSX before proceeding.

The STM.LDOS file produced can be processed by the plstm program.

For plotting the 2D results, you can use the gnuplot script in this directory.
