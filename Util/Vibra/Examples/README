      How to run the examples provided in this folder
      -----------------------------------------------

For instance, to run the system si54 (assuming that the executables
of fcbuild, siesta and vibrator are in the current directory; otherwise, 
provide the appropriate paths):  

1) Run:   

   $ fcbuild < si54.fdf

   this will build a file FC.fdf that will be a partial input for Siesta

2) Run:

   $ siesta < si54-siesta.fdf

   si54-siesta.fdf includes all the info required by Siesta,
   including that of file FC.fdf (which is included in the last
   statement of si54-siesta.fdf).

   Siesta will provide the file si54.FC with the force constant matrix

3) Run:

   $ vibrator < si54.fdf

   This will read the information writen by Siesta in si54.FC,
   and calculate the phonon band structure for Silicon. The 
   output is written in si54.bands, which can be viewed using
   gnuplot (after processing it with gnubands, available among
   the Siesta utilities)
