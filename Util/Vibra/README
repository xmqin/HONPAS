INSTALLATION

There are three directories in this package:

Vibra:       Contains the sources of the codes
Docs:        Contains a user guide of the VIBRA package
Examples:    Contains several examples of input and output files



There are two programs included in this package (in Vibra directory):

* fcbuild.f
  Builds the supercell, in FDF format, to be read by your Forces
  program (typically, SIESTA)

* vibra.f 
  Reads the force constants matrix, calculated by your Forces program
  (typically SIESTA), and computes the phonon spectrum.

Makefile will generate the executables for both programs.
Use make if you wish to compile both codes. 
Use make fcbuild if you only wish to compile fcbuild
Use make vibra if you only wish to compile vibra
