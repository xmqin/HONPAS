Utilities to deal with wave-function files

readwfx.f90: Provides information about the contents of a WFSX file
             type 'readwfx -h' for options

wfsnc2wfsx.F90: Converts a WFS.nc netCDF file (produced by the 'diagk_file' option)
                to the WFSX format.


The rest deal with the deprecated WFS format:

wfs2wfsx.f: Opposite conversion.
