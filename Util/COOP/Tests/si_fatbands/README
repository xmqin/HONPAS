Get the data from Tests/si_fatbands, i.e., copy the si_fatbands.HSX
and the si_fatbands.bands.WFSX files, and process them:

/path/to/fat [options] fatbands

Then, a number of .EIGFAT files will be produced. These files contain
*both* the eigenvalues and the projection weight for each orbital set
in the .mpr file, and can be re-processed by the "eigfat2plot" program
in Util/Bands to produce a data file suitable for plotting by Gnuplot.

Alternatively, users might want to produce their own post-processors.


The process in more detail:

#
# Copy the .HSX and .bands.WFSX file from the working directory where
# you ran the 'si_fatbands' test.
#
# Rename the si_fatbands.bands.WFSX file to 'si_fatbands.WFSX'.
#
# Execute the 'fat' program (compile it first in the COOP directory)

../../fat fatbands
#
# Now process the EIGFAT files:
#
../../../Bands/eigfat2plot fatbands.fatbands_Si_3s.EIGFAT > 3s.dat
../../../Bands/eigfat2plot fatbands.fatbands_Si_3p.EIGFAT > 3p.dat
../../../Bands/eigfat2plot fatbands.fatbands_Si_3d.EIGFAT > 3d.dat
#
# Plot with gnuplot, with typical commands:
#

plot "3s.dat" using 1:2:(4*$3) with points pt 6 ps variable  
replot "3p.dat" using 1:2:(4*$3) with points pt 6 ps variable
