Example of spin-texture generation

Copy to this directory the bi2se3_sql.HSX and bi2se3_sql.bands.WFSX files
from the bi2se3_sql calculation in Tests.

Then execute:

 ln -sf bi2se3_sql.bands.WFSX bi2se3_sql.WFSX
 ../../spin_texture bi2se3_sql > spin_texture.dat

to generate spin-texture information.

You can use the -m and -M options to restrict the energy window.

For example, for this system the Fermi level is around -5 eV (see the
output file of the Siesta calculation). Then,

 ../../spin_texture -M 0.0 bi2se3_sql > spin_texture-0.dat

will eliminate too-high energies. Similarly '-m Min_Energy' would eliminate
energies below Min_Energy.

The energy window could also be specified in the fdf file for the Siesta calculation
(see manual).
