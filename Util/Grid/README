Utility programs for processing Grid magnitudes (charge densities,
potentials...). The most relevant are:

grid2cdf:   Convert from standard binary format to netCDF format
cdf2grid:   Convert in reverse

cdf2xsf:    Generate an Xcrysden "xsf" file directly from a netCDF grid file.

cdf_diff:   Generate a "difference" netCDF file for a system composed of
            two parts:  diff = Total - part1 - part2
	    (e.g., for a molecule on a surface)

cdf_laplacian: Computes the (-) laplacian of a grid function stored in
               netCDF format.

grid2val:   Computes values of grid magnitudes at arbitrary points.
grid2cube:  Converts to Gaussian Cube format

g2c_ng:    (experimental) New version of grid2cube with some extra features,
           such as the possibility to deal with non-orthorhombic cells, and
	   the generation of supercells. (No changes of origin yet)

v_info:    (experimental) Plots the plane average V(z) of an electrostatic
           potential function in a grid-format file.
