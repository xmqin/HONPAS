This direcotry contains tools to work with the SIESTA's
main XML output file. This file follows the CMLComp
subset of the Chemical Markup Language. Further information
and resources can be found at http://cmlcomp.org/

Tools:

1) ccViz - transforms SystemLabel.xml to SystemLabel.xhtml 
           for viewing in a Web Browser. This should work on most
           Unix or Mac OS X systems and is run like so:

              ./ccViz SystemLabel.xml

           A file called SystemLabel.xhtml will be produced, this
           can be loaded into a Browser. The document includes 
           support for viewing three-dimensional interactive 
           images of the system using jMol. This is a Java applet 
           that can either be installed locally (in /usr/local/jmol)
           or loaded directly from the web.

           An online version of this tool is avalable from 
           http://cmlcomp.org/ccViz/, as are updated versions of
	   this script.
