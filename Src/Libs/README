Use the code in this directory if you do not have compiled (presumably
optimized) blas and lapack libraries in your system.

Define COMP_LIBS = libsiestaLAPACK.a libsiestaBLAS.a

	in your XXXXX.make file

You might already have an optimized blas, but not lapack, in which case:

	COMP_LIBS= libsiestaLAPACK.a $BLAS_LIBS
