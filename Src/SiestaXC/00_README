SiestaXC library

This directory contains those files specific to the siestaXC library which do not
reside in the main Siesta Src directory. The compilation mechanism is automatic. The
Src files will be discovered using VPATH, and the library and module files copied
automatically to the Obj directory.

To create a self-contained distribution of the whole library (which will include
the needed Src files), do

   make dist      (you might need to 'touch ../arch.make' if you are under Src)

and package appropriately the resulting SiestaXC directory.
