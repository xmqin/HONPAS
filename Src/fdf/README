This is the original FDF package, by Alberto Garcia and Jose Soler.

We request that the copyright notices in the code be kept if the package is
eventually used as part of another program.

NOTES:

The library, as compiled, still depends on the functionality of an
"io" package. In Siesta, that is provided by file Src/io.f (which has
its own Siesta-specific dependencies). If you use fdf in your program,
you will need to link it to something similar to the code in
io_for_fdf_tests.f.
