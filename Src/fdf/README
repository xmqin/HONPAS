The FDF package, designed by Alberto Garcia and Jose Soler, has been
reimplemented by Raul de la Cruz (Barcelona Supercomputer Center).

The library is memory-side instead of file-oriented, and works better
and faster than before. Supports MPI executions (outputs have
different names for each node), Cluster mode (at least one node only
has access to the input file) and Blocking mode (reading phase is
split in several steps for huge execution in shared-filesystems).

We request that the copyright notices in the code be kept if the package
is eventually used as part of another program.
