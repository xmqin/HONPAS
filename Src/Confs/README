These files are provided only as examples of 'configure' invokations.
Please note that the configure engine might not be able to figure out
everything (this is particularly true of netCDF configuration, and
certainly of MPI configuration, for which not much real support is
possible), and that some fine tuning of the resulting 'arch.make' file
will be needed. See Src/Sys/DOCUMENTED-TEMPLATE.make for guidance.
