subroutine Mmn( ispin ) 
!
!     In this subroutine we compute the overlaps between Bloch orbitals
!     at neighboring k points:
!
!     $M_{m n}^{(\vec{k}, \vec{b})} = 
!        \langle u_{m \vec{k}} \vbar u_{n \vec{k} + \vec{b} \rangle$
!
!     Eq. (27) of the paper by N. Marzari et al. 
!     Review of Modern Physics 84, 1419 (2012)
!
!     In the previous formula, only the periodic part of the wave functions
!     at neighbour k-points enter in the Equation.
!     We have to adapt this equation to the input provided by Siesta
!     (the coefficients of the whole wave function, not only of the periodic
!     part). 
!     This is done following Eq. (5) of the paper by 
!     D. Sanchez-Portal et al., Fundamental Physics for Ferroelectrics 
!     (AIP Conf. Proc. Vol 535) ed R. Cohen (Melville, AIP) pp 111-120 (2000).
!
!     OUTPUT: 
!     File called seedname.mmn, where the overlap matrices are written in 
!     the format required by Wannier90
