Makefile fragments to compile SIESTA on different architectures and compilers.

* Look for a .make file in this directory that might be appropriate
  for your particular configuration. If there is none, write your own
  using the existing files, and DOCUMENTED-TEMPLATE.make as guides.
  Note that some of these files are retained for historical purposes,
  and they might be out of date. Some files refer to computers of
  special interest to developers, and the locations of installed
  libraries might differ from your own.

* Copy or link the file to the build directory (Obj in the top level
  by default), renaming it as "arch.make".

THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR:

* If you have trouble compiling .F90 files, it might be that your compiler
does not recognize the .F90 suffix as a "in need of preprocessing, free
form, source file". Then you need to do the preprocessing *before* invoking
the compiler. See example in DOCUMENTED-TEMPLATE.make.

* The Portland Group's pgf9X compiler (several versions) produces bad
code when compiling atom.f and electrostatic.f with optimization. A
special set of rules has been inserted in some files so that no
optimization is used. You might need to consider it for your own
arch.make. See example in DOCUMENTED-TEMPLATE.make.
