SIESTA is a program for efficient electronic structure calculations
and ab initio molecular dynamics simulations of molecules and
solids in the framework of Density-Functional Theory (DFT).
SIESTA's efficiency stems from the use of a basis set of
strictly-localized atomic orbitals. A very important feature of the
code is that its accuracy and cost can be tuned in a wide range, from
quick exploratory calculations to highly accurate simulations matching
the quality of other approaches, such as plane-wave methods.

The main web page for the project is at [icmab.es/siesta](https://icmab.es/siesta).

Further information:

* Siesta development is multi-pronged, with stable, beta, and various
other branches with the latest features. A guide to the different
versions can be found
[in the project wiki](https://gitlab.com/siesta-project/siesta/-/wikis/Guide-to-Siesta-versions).

* TranSiesta is now part of the executable, see the documentation for details.

* The LaTeX source for the manual is in Docs/siesta.tex. Assuming you have
a working Tex/LaTeX installation, you can type `make final` to generate a pdf file.
Alternatively, manuals in pdf can be found in the Documentation section of the main web page.

* Tutorial material can be found also in the Documentation section of the main web page.
