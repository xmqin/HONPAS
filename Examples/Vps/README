Here are the input files used to generate some of the pseudopotentials
in Src/Tests/Pseudos. You might want to use them to practice running
the program ATOM (see directory Pseudo). You also have the .psf pseudopotential
files needed to run the examples.

These pseudopotentials are provided only as examples, and we do not 
guarantee their accuracy or transferability. We warn you that
pseudopotential generation may be tricky,  and that all pseudopotentials
should be thoroughly checked by the user before relying on them.
