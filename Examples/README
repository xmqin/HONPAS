Here you can find example fdf and pseudopotential files.

There are also pseudopotential-generation input files.  You don't need
to generate your pseudos to run these examples, but it is very
advisable to know how to generate and test pseudopotentials. See the
Pseudo directory at the top level.

Other, ready-to-run examples, can be found in directory Tests in the
main distribution.
