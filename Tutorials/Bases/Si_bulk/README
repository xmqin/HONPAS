In this directory you are going to
test different basis sets and
real-space grid settings for Si.

Bring the SiXXX.ion 
files from a basis generation run
and create different siesta input
files to test them.
(there is already one for a SZ basis).

Change also the Cutoff values, but
do not go below 100 Ry or so...
