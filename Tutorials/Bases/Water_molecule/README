In this directory you are going to
test different basis sets and
real-space grid settings.

Bring the HXXX.ion and OXXX.ion 
files from a basis generation run
and create different siesta input
files to use different combinations
(there is already one for SZ bases).

Change also the Cutoff values, but
do not go below 100 Ry or so...
